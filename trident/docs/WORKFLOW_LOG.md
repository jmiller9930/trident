# TRIDENT — Unified workflow log (mandatory)

**Authority:** Cumulative, append-only audit record for directive execution. A reviewer must be able to reconstruct system evolution from this file.

**Rules:** Do not rewrite prior sections. Failed attempts and gate outcomes stay visible. Directive work must land with a matching append to this log.

---

## Directive: WORKFLOW_LOG_INIT

**Status:** PASS

### Plan

Establish `trident/docs/WORKFLOW_LOG.md` as the single unified workflow log; backfill **100A → 100F** at summary level for continuity; align engineering receipts with program gate decisions already recorded in thread / prior audit notes.

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — program mandated file path, section schema, append-only discipline, and summary backfill requirement.

### Build Summary

Created this log file with standardized sections per program specification.

### Files Changed

- `trident/docs/WORKFLOW_LOG.md` (new)

### Commands Run

`git log --oneline` (scope: `trident/backend`, `trident/docs`) to anchor representative SHAs for backfill.

### Tests

N/A (documentation-only init).

### Proof

Repo HEAD at authoring: `4482f2c`; backfill SHAs cross-checked against git history for 100A–100C and recent 100D–100E chain.

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — mandatory log path and format satisfied; backfill present through **100F (current)**.

### Final State

Unified workflow logging is enforceable: future directives append new `## Directive: <ID>` blocks below.

### Known Gaps

Summary backfill is not a full forensic reconstruction; exact historical dates per gate may be refined via future **correction append** rows if records diverge.

### Unlock

All subsequent directives must append here; **100F** build remains gated on explicit plan acknowledgment.

---

## Directive: 100A

**Status:** PASS

### Plan

Implement repository + runtime skeleton per `TRIDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE_100A_REPOSITORY_RUNTIME_SKELETON.md` (layout, health/config placeholders, validation proof path, `/trident` deploy alignment).

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — skeleton scope only (no agent logic, memory, MCP, router, UI business logic, git automation).

### Build Summary

Initial `trident/` tree (backend, frontend, worker, docker, docs, `runtime/proof/`), compose baseline, base-path aware routing and clawbot deployment documentation.

### Files Changed

Summary: `trident/backend/**`, `trident/docker-compose.yml`, `trident/docs/**`, `trident/runtime/**`; representative commits `fb109eb`, `ed1b6f9`, `c52bd01`, `23930fe`.

### Commands Run

`pytest` (includes base-path `/trident` tests); `docker compose config` where environment allowed — per `trident/runtime/proof/100A_PROOF_NOTES.txt`.

### Tests

**PASS** — pytest per proof notes; full compose up/curl/restart not run in agent/CI environment (documented).

### Proof

`trident/runtime/proof/100A_PROOF_NOTES.txt`; commits above.

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — skeleton + documented deploy target; explicit caveat on Docker daemon not available in some validation environments.

### Final State

Runtime skeleton and deployment checklist baseline; unlocks schema work (**100B**).

### Known Gaps

Docker runtime proof left to environments with Docker daemon (per 100A proof notes).

### Unlock

**100B** enabled.

---

## Directive: 100B

**Status:** PASS

### Plan

Implement schema models, persistence, and migrations for core records per `TRIDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE_100B_SCHEMA_PERSISTENCE_FOUNDATION.md` (directives, ledger, graph state, handoffs, proofs, audits, workspace/user placeholders, file-lock placeholder).

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — persistence foundation only (no LangGraph execution semantics beyond storage, no memory/MCP/router/UI).

### Build Summary

SQLAlchemy models, repositories, Alembic baseline migration `100b001_initial_schema.py`, audited directive pathway scaffolding.

### Files Changed

`trident/backend/app/models/**`, `trident/backend/app/repositories/**`, `trident/backend/alembic/versions/100b001_initial_schema.py`, related API/tests; anchor commit `9b91430`.

### Commands Run

Alembic revision application in dev/validation contexts; pytest for persistence layer (per implementation).

### Tests

**PASS** — foundation covered by project test suite at time of merge (summary).

### Proof

Commit `9b91430`; migration `100b001`.

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — schema + migration foundation merged.

### Final State

Durable persistence for ledger/graph/proof/audit primitives; unlocks LangGraph spine (**100C**).

### Known Gaps

None recorded at summary level.

### Unlock

**100C** enabled.

---

## Directive: 100C

**Status:** PASS

### Plan

Implement LangGraph workflow spine per `TRIDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE_100C_LANGGRAPH_SPINE.md` (Architect → Engineer → Reviewer → Docs → Close, rejection loop; persistence via **100B**).

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — all multi-agent execution routed through LangGraph nodes only.

### Build Summary

`StateGraph` spine, persistence hooks, API entry for directive workflow execution, ledger/audit writes aligned to graph transitions.

### Files Changed

`trident/backend/app/workflow/**`, `trident/backend/app/api/v1/directives.py`, `trident/backend/tests/test_langgraph_spine.py`; anchor commit `fdec2b8`.

### Commands Run

`pytest` including `tests/test_langgraph_spine.py`.

### Tests

**PASS** — LangGraph spine tests green at merge (summary).

### Proof

Commit `fdec2b8`; test module `test_langgraph_spine.py`.

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — enforced graph execution path present.

### Final State

Governed multi-agent execution shell; unlocks memory system (**100D**).

### Known Gaps

Placeholder behaviors in some nodes per directive (no full code mutation stack).

### Unlock

**100D** enabled.

---

## Directive: 100D

**Status:** PASS

### Plan

Implement memory system per `TRIDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE_100D_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md` (Chroma integration, graph-governed writes, scoped reads, validation).

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — memory scope only; sequencing later locked as **100D → FIX 004 → 100E** before **100E** build.

### Build Summary

Memory writer/read paths, Chroma integration (PersistentClient local / HttpClient Docker), MiniLM embedding path, migration support for memory entries.

### Files Changed

Memory modules, `trident/backend/tests/test_memory_100d.py`, `trident/backend/alembic/versions/100d003_memory_entries.py`; anchor commit `b0113bf`.

### Commands Run

`pytest tests/test_memory_100d.py` local and clawbot (`TRIDENT_CHROMA_HOST=trident-chroma`); compose services per deployment docs.

### Tests

**PASS** — 5/5 memory tests local PersistentClient; 5/5 clawbot HttpClient after stable embedding download; environmental ONNX fetch interruption treated as re-run, not code FAIL.

### Proof

Commit `b0113bf`; structured proof summarized in prior audit (`DIRECTIVE_WORKFLOW_LOG.md` row W-003); clawbot + local receipts per thread.

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — program **ACCEPTED** structured proof (local + clawbot).

### Final State

Memory subsystem operational enough to gate **FIX 004** (transaction / vector consistency) before **100E**.

### Known Gaps

Embedding download can fail on flaky networks (operational re-run).

### Unlock

**FIX 004** (program gate) then **100E**.

---

## Directive: 100E

**Status:** PASS

### Plan

Implement Git read-only validation and strict file locks with simulated mutation proof per `TRIDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE_100E_GIT_FILE_LOCK.md`, after **FIX 004** closure.

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — lock lifecycle, conflict handling, audits, containerized proof on clawbot.

### Build Summary

File lock model + constraints, git path safety / read-only git, lock API routes, `clawbot_100e_proof.py`, API image includes `git` + tests for compose-exec pytest.

### Files Changed

`trident/backend/app/locks/**`, `trident/backend/app/git/**`, API v1 locks, `trident/backend/clawbot_100e_proof.py`, `trident/backend/tests/test_locks_100e.py`, `trident/backend/alembic/versions/100e001_file_lock_git_constraints.py`; commits `c70c7ce`, `4482f2c`.

### Commands Run

`docker compose` rebuild; `alembic upgrade head`; Postgres proof script (acquire / conflict / release / re-acquire / simulated mutation); **restart `trident-api`**; `pytest tests/test_locks_100e.py` (8 passed in container).

### Tests

**PASS** — 8 passed in container per program sign-off.

### Proof

HEAD proof bundle `4482f2c`; Alembic `100e001`; audit events `GIT_STATUS_CHECKED` / `DIFF_GENERATED`; prior audit row W-005.

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — program **ACCEPTED** full proof list (lock/conflict/release/restart/read-only git/mutation/proofs/audits/tests).

### Final State

Governed file locking + git evidence path validated on clawbot; unlocks downstream directives including **100F** implementation once planned.

### Known Gaps

Non-blocking: orphan `trident-vector` noted during clawbot validation.

### Unlock

**100F** build (pending plan acknowledgment).

---

## Directive: 100F

**Status:** BLOCKED

### Plan

Implement MCP execution layer per `TRIDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE_100F_MCP_EXECUTION.md` after governed Read → Plan → Build sequence.

### Plan Decision

**CHANGES REQUESTED / PENDING** — engineering submitted **Step 1 Read** + **Step 2 Plan**; explicit architect acknowledgment of plan **not yet recorded**; **no build** authorized until then.

### Build Summary

N/A — implementation not started (blocked on plan gate).

### Files Changed

N/A for implementation (planning artifacts may exist only in chat / directive workspace until build).

### Commands Run

N/A for build.

### Tests

N/A.

### Proof

N/A — planning delivery only; prior audit row W-001 **PENDING**.

### Gate Decision

**CONDITIONAL** — **BLOCKED** until plan acknowledgment; Step 3 Build not authorized; no merge closure without proof block.

### Final State

No MCP execution layer merged; system remains without governed MCP command path until unblock.

### Known Gaps

Full MCP adapters (SSH stub only per directive), approval UX, and integration with LangGraph nodes remain future work post-unblock.

### Unlock

Next: architect **ACCEPTED** plan → engineering **Build** → proof → **PASS** gate → append completion section or new status block (append-only).

---

## Directive: 100F — Step 3 Build (accepted plan)

**Status:** PASS

### Plan

Implement MCP execution API (`POST /api/v1/mcp/classify`, `POST /api/v1/mcp/execute`) with simulated adapters only, HIGH explicit-approval gate, `ProofObject(EXECUTION_LOG)` receipts, and audits (`MCP_EXECUTION_REQUESTED`, `MCP_EXECUTION_COMPLETED`, `MCP_EXECUTION_REJECTED`, `MCP_EXECUTION_FAILED` available).

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — program authorization to proceed with Step 3 Build; simulated execution only; no router/memory/Nike/UI/file-git mutation.

### Build Summary

New `app/mcp/` package (classifier, validator, service, audit logger, FastAPI `mcp_router`, local + SSH **stub** adapters). Execute path persists EXECUTION_LOG proofs (including HIGH rejection receipts). DB session commits on `HTTPException` so rejection audits/receipts survive 403 responses.

### Files Changed

`trident/backend/app/mcp/**`, `trident/backend/app/schemas/mcp.py`, `trident/backend/app/api/routes.py`, `trident/backend/app/db/session.py`, `trident/backend/tests/conftest.py`, `trident/backend/tests/test_mcp_100f.py`, `trident/backend/clawbot_100f_proof.py`, `trident/backend/Dockerfile`, `trident/backend/app/models/enums.py`.

### Commands Run

`python3 -m pytest` — full suite **61 passed** (includes `tests/test_mcp_100f.py`).

### Tests

**PASS** — classification; LOW auto path; HIGH 403 without `explicitly_approved`; HIGH success with flag; ssh_stub adapter; invalid target; package contains no `subprocess` / `os.system`.

### Proof

API base `/api/v1/mcp/`; required context fields enforced; clawbot script `clawbot_100f_proof.py` (DB seed + httpx against live API). Git: merge commit titled **`feat(100F): MCP classify/execute API with simulated adapters`** (verify with `git log -1 --oneline`).

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — meets simulated-only execution, HIGH gate, receipt + audit visibility requirements.

### Final State

MCP classify/execute available for governed intent capture; unlocks **100G Router** per directive manifest (not implemented here).

### Known Gaps

SSH adapter remains stub; MEDIUM “optional approval” not modeled as separate token (execute always re-classifies); LangGraph node wiring to MCP API not in scope.

### Unlock

**100G** (Router) authorized per parent directive manifest when program issues next gate.

---

## Directive: 100F_FINAL — Clawbot HTTP + DB + restart

**Status:** PENDING (operator must run on clawbot; see script output for PASS/FAIL)

### Plan

Final validation: all MCP calls over HTTP to `http://localhost:8000/trident/api/v1/mcp/...` (with `TRIDENT_BASE_PATH=/trident`); DB receipt counts; `docker compose restart trident-api` then re-run LOW execute.

### Plan Decision

**ACCEPTED** — program requires clawbot proof before **100G**; no router work.

### Build Summary

- `clawbot_100f_final_validation.py` — full phase: DB bootstrap directive, HTTP classify/LOW/HIGH-reject/HIGH-ok, assert 3× `EXECUTION_LOG` proofs, 3× `MCP_EXECUTION_REQUESTED`, 2× `MCP_EXECUTION_COMPLETED`, 1× `MCP_EXECUTION_REJECTED`.
- `--phase restart-low` with `TRIDENT_100F_DIRECTIVE_ID` / `TRIDENT_100F_TASK_ID` after API restart.
- `agent_role` accepted case-insensitively (e.g. `engineer` → `ENGINEER`) for architect curl examples.

### Files Changed

`trident/backend/clawbot_100f_final_validation.py`, `trident/backend/app/mcp/mcp_validator.py`, `trident/backend/tests/test_mcp_100f.py`, `trident/backend/Dockerfile`.

### Commands Run (CI / dev)

`python3 -m pytest` — full suite **62 passed**.

### Clawbot (operator)

```bash
ssh jmiller@clawbot.a51.corp
cd ~/code_projects/trident/trident/trident
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec trident-api python -m alembic current
docker compose exec trident-api python clawbot_100f_final_validation.py
docker compose restart trident-api
# then use printed export + restart-low command
```

Curl samples (replace UUIDs from script output): `POST .../trident/api/v1/mcp/classify` and `/execute` as in program message.

### Gate Decision

**PENDING** until clawbot run shows `100f_final_validation_ok=1` and `100f_final_restart_low_ok=1`.

### Final State

When PASS: **100F** closed for deployment target; **100G** still blocked until program explicitly enables.

### Known Gaps

Local engineering host may lack Docker/SSH to clawbot; final sign-off is on **clawbot** only.

---

## Directive: 100F_FINAL — Clawbot execution record

**Status:** PASS

### Proof (clawbot `2026-04-30`)

- **Git:** `7f3153c` on clawbot workspace after `git pull`.
- **Alembic:** `100e001 (head)`.
- **HTTP base:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/trident/api/v1` (compose `TRIDENT_BASE_PATH=/trident`).
- **Full validation:** `100f_final_validation_ok=1`; classify **LOW**; LOW execute **200**; HIGH reject **403** `high_risk_not_approved` proof `1712d96d-7310-46c5-b6a6-2448e94dfaa7`; HIGH approved **200**; DB `proof_objects_exec_log_count=3`, `mcp_audit_requested=3 completed=2 rejected=1`.
- **Restart LOW:** after `docker compose restart trident-api`, `restart_low_execute_status=200`, proof `150b95ec-132a-4123-b4ed-f80923f2c4d0`, `100f_final_restart_low_ok=1`.
- **Directive/task IDs (proof run):** `6dcf3ddd-d393-4871-ba5e-c220e2e68821` / `93712920-db08-4fe8-ab2f-ff29c5307a06`.

### Gate Decision

**PASS** — clawbot validation script green end-to-end including persistence after API restart.
